         is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS)
         used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing,
         spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is all purpose GIS although it is focused mainly
         on scientific GIS applications involving big data.
         GRASS GIS is the Open Source Geospatial Foundation
         (<a href="http://osgeo.org">OSGeo</a>) project.</p>
      <p>We contribute to the GRASS GIS project by developing new features
         and as a part of GRASS GIS community we support faculty and students using GRASS.
         The NCSU OSGeoREL leader, Dr. Helena Mitasova, is the co-author of the book
         <a href="http://www.grassbook.org/">Open Source GIS: A GRASS GIS Approach</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> is a free and open source GIS
         which is easy to use and enables sophisticated cartographic outputs.
         QGIS is fully-fledged alternative to proprietary
         tools in terms of functionality, user interface and commercial support.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://github.com/ncsu-osgeorel/">NCSU OSGeoREL organization at GitHub</a></h4>
      <p>GitHub is a repository hosting service which works with Git repositories.
      We manage there our projects' source codes. Specifically, we use GitHub for
      projects which are not part of any other free and open source project
      but we want to share them with community.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://github.ncsu.edu/osgeorel">NCSU OSGeoREL organization at NCSU GitHub Enterprise</a></h4>
      <p>NCSU provides us with access to GitHub Enterprise which is not publicly accessible.
      We manage there only internal one-purpose projects which are not suitable for publishing.
      If you are part of NCSU, you can still access some of them but anyway majority of our projects
      is available in other repositories.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/">GRASS GIS repository</a></h4>
      <p>A lot of our code goes directly to GRASS GIS, specifically to its Subversion (SVN) repository
      which is available online through GRASS GIS <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/">Trac</a>
      or <a href="http://svn.osgeo.org/grass/grass/">SVN HTML browser</a>.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass-addons">GRASS GIS Addons repository</a></h4>
      <p>We try to create most of our tools as GRASS modules which we publish in GRASS Addons repository.
      GRASS Addons Subversion (SVN) repository is available online in the same way as GRASS GIS code itself
      through GRASS GIS <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/">Trac</a>
      or <a href="http://svn.osgeo.org/grass/grass-addons/">SVN HTML browser</a>.</p>
