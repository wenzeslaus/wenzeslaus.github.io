My name is Vaclav Petras but you may know me also as Vašek [Vasheck].

I am first year PhD student in the Department of Marine Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (MEAS) at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and a member of the NCSU OSGeo Research and Education Laboratory (OSGeoREL). I'm involved in the GRASS GIS development (see my GRASS Wiki home page for details).

<p>
Vashek’s research includes landscape evolution analysis in coastal areas
based on space-time cube concept, GIS-based environmental modeling of natural phenomena,
web-based spatio-temporal visualizations for communicating research,
and finally geospatial software quality assessment,
which allows he and other scientists to test the proper functionality of various geospatial algorithms.
Vashek collaborates on free and open source software development, most notably, development of GRASS GIS.
He believes that open source software is a crucial part of open and reproducible science and that providing
his work as open source allows equal opportunities for all scientists around the world to use,
critique, and further develop the results of his research.
