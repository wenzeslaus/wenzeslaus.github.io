        <h4>Environmental modeling in free and open source GIS</h4>
        <p>
            I pursue a topic of GIS-based environmental modeling
            because I consider GIS to be advantageous for different
            kinds of modeling, especially when different data needs to be combined.
            However, I don't think that any GIS would be such a great advantage.
            I actually think that only free and open source GIS can do the service
            to modelers well because of long-term sustainability, community support
            and most importantly complete openness and freedom.
            Consequently, I have created or improved several modeling tools in GRASS GIS
            where one can find many examples of environmental models
            and how they are maintained and improved over years.

        <h4>Communicating research through visualizations online</h4>
        <p>
            I work on lightweight solutions for publishing maps and
            spatio-temporal visualizations for communicating research
            online using both web-based and desktop-based tools.
            The goal is to make sharing visualizations online
            as simple as it is to share a simple picture.
            The point is that this can even include a simple picture
            such as animated GIF if this is an sufficient solution to given task.

        <h4>Enabling science through usage of free and open source software</h4>
        <p>
            I collaborate on free and open source software development,
            most notably, development of GRASS GIS.
            I believe that open source software is a crucial part of
            open and reproducible science and that providing
            my work as open source allows equal opportunities
            for all scientists around the world to use,
            critique, and further develop the results of my research.

        <h4>Rapidly changing landscape evolution analysis</h4>
        <p>
            I work on different tools for landscape evolution analysis
            with a focus one rapidly evolving coastal areas.
            I'm using a concept of space-time cube to represent and model
            space and time.

        <h4>Exploratory visualizations spatial and spatio-temporal data</h4>
        <p>
            I'm interested in visualization tools which help scientist understand their
            data and derive meaning and results from them.
