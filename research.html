        <h4>Point cloud data analysis</h4>
        <p>
            I focus on developing practical methods and software tools
            for processing large point clouds from lidar or structure
            from motion (UAV) data processing. My idea is to develop
            tools which will not only derive the information from the
            data, but tools which will be also able to work with other
            geospatial processing tools and will serve as a base for
            future algorithms.

        <p>
            I work on different tools for landscape evolution analysis
            with a focus one rapidly evolving coastal areas.
            I'm using a concept of space-time cube to represent and model
            space and time.

            I explore new ways how to share scientific results and methods
            in the field of geospatial sciences.

            I work on methods and software tools for geospatial
            software quality assessment, which allows he and other
            scientists to test the proper functionality of various
            geospatial algorithms.

        <h4>Environmental modeling in free and open source GIS</h4>
        <p>
            I pursue a topic of GIS-based environmental modeling
            because I consider GIS to be advantageous for different
            kinds of modeling, especially when different data needs to be combined.
            However, I don't think that just any GIS is such a great advantage.
            I actually think that only free and open source GIS can do the service
            to modelers well because of long-term sustainability, community support
            and most importantly complete openness and freedom.
            Consequently, I have created or improved several modeling tools in GRASS GIS
            where one can find many examples of environmental models
            and how they are maintained and improved over years.

        <h4>Communicating research through visualizations online</h4>
        <p>
            I work on lightweight solutions for publishing maps and
            spatio-temporal visualizations for communicating research
            online using both web-based and desktop-based tools.
            The goal is to make sharing visualizations online
            as simple as it is to share a simple picture.
            The point is that this can even include a simple picture
            such as animated GIF if this is an sufficient solution to given task.

        <h4>Enabling science through usage of free and open source software</h4>
        <p>
            I collaborate on free and open source software development,
            most notably, development of GRASS GIS.
            I believe that open source software is a crucial part of
            open and reproducible science and that providing
            my work as open source allows equal opportunities
            for all scientists around the world to use,
            critique, and further develop the results of my research.

        <h4>Exploratory visualizations spatial and spatio-temporal data</h4>
        <p>
            I'm interested in visualization tools which help scientist understand their
            data and derive meaning and results from them.
