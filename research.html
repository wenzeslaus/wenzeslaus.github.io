        <h4>Enabling science through usage of free and open source software</h4>
        <p>
            I collaborate on free and open source software development,
            most notably, development of GRASS GIS.
            I believe that open source software is a crucial part of
            open and reproducible science and that providing
            my work as open source allows equal opportunities
            for all scientists around the world to use,
            critique, and further develop the results of my research.
