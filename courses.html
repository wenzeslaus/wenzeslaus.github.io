      <h4><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea582/common/GIST.html">GIS/MEA582: Geospatial Analysis and Modeling</a></h4>
      <p>The course explains digital representation and analysis of geospatial phenomena
         and provides foundations in methods and algorithms used in GIS analysis.
         Special focus is on terrain modeling, geomorphometry, watershed analysis
         and introductory GIS-based modeling of landscape processes (water, sediment).
         The course includes analysis from lidar data, 3D visualization, and exploratory
         land management design with Tangible GIS. Assignments are performed in Open source GRASS GIS and ArcGIS.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea592/common/GIST_MEA592005.html">MEA592: Multidimensional Geospatial Modeling</a></h4>
      <p>The course covers concepts, methods and tools for analysis and modeling of landscape
         dynamics using multitemporal georeferenced data and simulations. Representation of evolving
         phenomena using point clouds and particles, surfaces and voxel models will be explained.
         The course will also include hands-on practice and development of techniques for visualization
         and communication of lidar data time series and outputs of dynamic simulations using the state of the art
         technology in the GIST Visualization laboratory, such as 3D projection, immersion and tangible modeling system.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea792/common/GIST_MEA792.html">GIS/MEA792: Advanced Geospatial Modeling</a></h4>
      <p>The course provides foundations in methods and algorithms used in GIS modeling.
         Special focus is on integrated modeling using vector and raster data processing,
         data base management tools, basic image processing, and python programing for open source GIS.
         The course includes workflow development combining different tools from open source geospatial
         software stack especially GRASS GIS, GDAL/OGR, libLAS and others. Applications / case studies
         will include terrain modeling, geomorphometry, coastal evolution, volume modeling, dynamic visualization,
         and GIS-based modeling of landscape processes (water, sediment).</p>

      <h4><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/gis550/common/index.html">GIS 550: Geospatial Data Structures and Web Services</a></h4>
      <p>This course examines the spatial database models and structures used in geospatial
         information science and technology as well as the design and implementation of web
         and related mobile computing geospatial tools and systems. Students develop, evaluate,
         and deploy multiple spatial data models and web services that include connections to external data sources and systems.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/lar582/common/">LAR 582.017: GIS for Designers</a></h4>
      <p>
      This course will focus on how GIS can be an integral part of the creative design process.
      You will be taught terrain, hydrological, and overlay modeling and analysis in two and three dimensions.
      You will also learn how to generate and develop the seed of a design in GIS as part of an iterative design process.
      With visual programming students will learn how conceptual and logical models can structure and generate designs,
      linking creative abstraction, computational exploration, structured decision-making, and expression.
      As part of an iterative design process students will learn workflows linking 3D GIS,
      3D modeling, and rapid prototyping (3D printing, CNC fabrication, and laser cutting).</p>

      Spatio-temporal data handling and visualization in GRASS GIS</a></h4>
      <p>
         First, we will introduce you to GRASS GIS 7, including its spatio-temporal capabilities and you will learn how to manage and analyze geospatial data time series.
         Then, we will explore new tools for visualization of spatio-temporal data.
         You will create both 2D and 3D dynamic visualizations directly in GRASS GIS 7.
         Additionally, we will explain the Space Time Cube concept using various applications based on raster and vector data time series.
         You will learn to manage and visualize data in space time cubes (voxel models). No prior knowledge of GRASS GIS is necessary,
         we will cover the basics needed for the workshop.
         This is a workshop created for <a href="https://2014.foss4g.org/schedule/workshops/">FOSS4G 2014</a>.
