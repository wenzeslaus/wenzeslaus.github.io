            GRASS GIS covers geospatial analysis from hydrology through
            remote sensing to network analysis. Make your first steps
            in GRASS GIS in Geospatial Studio. Come few minutes sooner
            if you don't have GRASS GIS installed. After the
            introduction, there will be time to try your own data with
            GRASS GIS.

            Come and learn about scripting, graphical and tangible (!)
            interfaces for GRASS GIS, the powerful desktop GIS and
            geoprocessing backend. We will start with the Python
            interface and finish with Tangible Landscape, a new
            tangible interface for GRASS GIS.  Python is the primary
            scripting language for GRASS GIS. We will demonstrate how
            to use Python to automate your geoprocessing workflows with
            GRASS GIS modules and develop custom algorithms using a
            Pythonic interface to access low level GRASS GIS library
            functions. We will also review several tips and tricks for
            parallelization.  Tangible Landscape is an example of how
            the GRASS GIS Python API can be used to build new, cutting
            edge tools and advanced applications. Tangible Landscape is
            a collaborative 3D sketching tool which couples a 3D
            scanner, a projector and a physical 3D model with GRASS
            GIS. The workshop will be a truly hands-on experience – you
            will play with Tangible Landscape, using your hands to
            shape a sand model and drive geospatial processes.  This
            workshop is open to beginners. There will be opportunities,
            however, to discuss more advanced topics tailored to
            individual interests in breakout sessions during the
            workshop.  Participants should bring laptops with GRASS GIS
            7 and their favorite Python editor. Beginners may consider
            using the latest OSGeo-Live virtual machine.

        <p class="abstract">
            Spatial patterns of land use change due to urbanization and
            its impact on the landscape is the subject of ongoing
            research. Urban growth scenario simulation is a powerful
            tool for exploring these impacts and empowering planners to
            make informed decisions. In this workshop, we will
            introduce FUTURES (FUTure Urban - Regional Environment
            Simulation) - a patch-based, stochastic, multi-level land
            change modeling framework implemented in GRASS GIS 7.
            FUTURES is a fully open source land change modeling
            framework that accommodates multilevel drivers of land
            change across a heterogenous region.  Participants will
            learn the concepts, input data and general workflow of the
            model and get the chance to simulate emerging landscape
            spatial structure in urbanizing regions of North Carolina.
            We will start with hands-on exercises in GRASS GIS, a free
            and open source scientific platform for geoprocessing. We
            will cover spatial processing and analyses of urban growth
            predictors such as landscape topography, hydrography, cost
            and proximity, followed by introduction to spatio-temporal
            data handling and visualization. We will also demonstrate
            how GRASS GIS, Python and R interfaces can be leveraged for
            developing workflows, including tips and tricks for
            parallelization when working with ‘big data’. Participants
            will then run urban simulations using FUTURES with
            different possible population and spatial planning
            scenarios. This workshop is a great introduction to GRASS
            GIS including the unique tools available in GRASS GIS
            Addons repository.

        <p class="abstract">
            GRASS GIS is a leading software in analysis of geodata, it
            offers more than 400 modules in its core version plus many
            addons (i.e., user contributed modules). But what if the
            tool you are looking for is not present in GRASS GIS? So,
            simply create your own, we will show you how to do that in
            this workshop.  In GRASS GIS 7, Python is the default
            language for creating addons. There are two main Python
            libraries included in GRASS GIS. Python Scripting Library
            allows you to perform analysis and compute new data by
            chaining existing modules to create your own workflow.
            With PyGRASS library wrapping the C functions, you can
            create new data sets (vector and raster) directly through
            Python calls, increasing considerably the power and
            performance of your scripts. You can conveniently mix both
            GRASS Python libraries with other Python libraries like
            NumPy, or SciPy. In this workshop, we will guide you
            through the basic steps of writing your own Python scripts,
            starting with calling and chaining GRASS GIS modules,
            followed by a more pythonic experience when using PyGRASS
            to access and modify your data directly.  You will then
            upgrade your script into an addon by defining a simple
            interface to enable automatically generated GUI. The next
            part of workshop will look into more advanced usage of
            GRASS GIS 7 capabilities, including Python spatio-temporal
            API to handle time series in your addons, creating your own
            toolbox with your newly developed addons and finally,
            introducing the new testing framework you should use as a
            responsible person to make sure your addons are in great
            shape.  Don't worry if we won't cover all the topics during
            the workshop, all materials will be accessible online and
            GRASS GIS community is always prepared to answer your
            questions!

            First, we will introduce you to GRASS GIS 7, including its
            spatio-temporal capabilities and you will learn how to
            manage and analyze geospatial data time series. Then, we
            will explore new tools for visualization of spatio-temporal
            data. You will create both 2D and 3D dynamic visualizations
            directly in GRASS GIS 7. Additionally, we will explain the
            Space Time Cube concept using various applications based on
            raster and vector data time series. You will learn to
            manage and visualize data in space time cubes (voxel
            models). No prior knowledge of GRASS GIS is necessary, we
            will cover the basics needed for the workshop. This
            workshop was created for FOSS4G 2014.
