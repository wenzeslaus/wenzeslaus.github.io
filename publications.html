                Online publication of geospatial data is a common requirement of GIS users.
                Several free and open source solutions are available. These solutions
                include JavaScript libraries for building web map applications as well as
                server-side applications for data publishing. This project aims at GIS
                users which don't have an option to run a server-side applications
                and cannot build web map applications easily. The project consists of
                two loosely coupled parts where one or the other can be easily replaced by some other solution.
                First part is a set of web map applications. Each of them is specialized to
                different type of data, for example one application provides tools to
                show spatio-temporal data. Second part is connected to GRASS GIS and
                consists of a set of GRASS modules which provide several ways of
                exporting different types of data from GRASS GIS. Besides maps, other
                data such as statical values about maps are also exported. Connecting
                exported data and web applications is as easy as putting the files into
                the right directory. The solution enables easy publication without any
                requirements on user or publication servers and is intended to be used
                for ad hoc data sharing with colleagues which may or may not use GIS
                but for sure will appreciate interactive data visualization including
                additional information.

        <h4><a href="http://geo.fsv.cvut.cz/proj/dp/2013/vaclav-petras-dp-2013.pdf">Master’s thesis: Building detection from aerial images in GRASS GIS environment</a></h4>
        <p>
            Despite the current availability of various geographic data, building detection is still
            needed under some circumstances. These circumstances can include inaccessibility
            of cadastral data, unrecorded and illegal building detection and disaster mapping. A
            number of approaches has been developed to detect buildings which rely on different
            kinds of spatial and quality features such as shape or color in remotely sensed im-
            agery. The key properties differ among the various types of buildings (family house,
            factory, animal farm) and areas (city, rural area, state or country). This often re-
            quires the development of specialized detection algorithms. This work presents an
            algorithm developed to detect animal farm buildings in northern Italy. However, this
            implementation is intended to address not only the detection of farm buildings but
            to provide general tools for building detection in GRASS GIS. This work presents
            the implementation of an edge detector, line segment extractor and classification
            tool as well as the detection made on northern Italy orthophotos. All tools were
            implemented in the environment of the free and open source GIS software GRASS
            GIS. The use of free and open source software ensures that source code can be
            peer-reviewed and the analysis is highly reproducible.

            Currently, the program gama-local supports only XML as an input. Thanks
            to this thesis program can read input data from the SQLite database. The
            thesis deals with the specifics of the use of callback functions in C++ using
            the native SQLite C/C++ Application Programming Interface. Tests of

        <h4>Testing framework for GRASS GIS: ensuring reproducibility of scientific geospatial computing</h4>
        <p>Petras, V., Gebbert, S.</p>
        <p>
            GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS, is used by many scientists directly or through other projects such as R or QGIS to perform geoprocessing tasks. Thus, a large number of scientific geospatial computations depend on quality and correct functionality of GRASS GIS. Automatic functionality testing is therefore necessary to ensure software reliability. Here we present a testing framework for GRASS GIS which addresses different needs of GRASS GIS and geospatial software in general. It allows to test GRASS tools (referred to as GRASS modules) and examine outputs including large raster and vector maps as well as temporal datasets. Furthermore, it enables to test all levels of GRASS GIS architecture including C and Python application programming interface and GRASS modules invoked as subprocesses. Since GRASS GIS is used as a platform for development of geospatial algorithms and models, the testing framework allows not only to test GRASS GIS core functionality but also tools developed by scientists as a part of their research. Using testing framework we can test GRASS GIS and related tools automatically and repetitively and thus detect errors caused by code changes and new developments. Tools and code are then easier to maintain which results in preserving reproducibility of scientific results over time. Similarly to open source code, the test results are publicly accessible, so that all current and potential users can see them. The usage of testing framework will be presented on an example of a test suite for r.slope.aspect module, a tool for computation of terrain slope, aspect, curvatures and other terrain characteristics.
