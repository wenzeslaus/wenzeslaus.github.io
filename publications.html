                Online publication of geospatial data is a common requirement of GIS users.
                Several free and open source solutions are available. These solutions
                include JavaScript libraries for building web map applications as well as
                server-side applications for data publishing. This project aims at GIS
                users which don't have an option to run a server-side applications
                and cannot build web map applications easily. The project consists of
                two loosely coupled parts where one or the other can be easily replaced by some other solution.
                First part is a set of web map applications. Each of them is specialized to
                different type of data, for example one application provides tools to
                show spatio-temporal data. Second part is connected to GRASS GIS and
                consists of a set of GRASS modules which provide several ways of
                exporting different types of data from GRASS GIS. Besides maps, other
                data such as statical values about maps are also exported. Connecting
                exported data and web applications is as easy as putting the files into
                the right directory. The solution enables easy publication without any
                requirements on user or publication servers and is intended to be used
                for ad hoc data sharing with colleagues which may or may not use GIS
                but for sure will appreciate interactive data visualization including
                additional information.

            Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS</a></h4>
        <p>Petrasova, A., Harmon, B., <strong>Petras, V.</strong>, Mitasova, H., 2015.
        <em>Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS</em>. Springer International Publishing. doi:10.1007/978-3-319-25775-4
        <p class="abstract">
            This book presents a new type of modeling environment where users
            interact with geospatial simulations using 3D physical models of studied landscapes.
            Multiple users can alter the physical model by hand during scanning, thereby providing
            input for simulation of geophysical processes in this setting.
            The authors have developed innovative techniques and software that couple this hardware
            with open source GRASS GIS, making the system instantly applicable to a wide range of
            modeling and design problems. Since no other literature on this topic is available,
            this book fills a gap for this new technology that continues to grow.
            Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS will appeal to advanced-level students studying
            geospatial science, computer science and earth science such as  landscape architecture and natural resources. It will also benefit researchers and professionals  working in geospatial modeling applications, computer graphics, hazard risk management, hydrology, solar energy, coastal and fluvial flooding, fire spread, landscape, park design and computer games.

        <h4><a href="http://geo.fsv.cvut.cz/proj/dp/2013/vaclav-petras-dp-2013.pdf">Master’s thesis: Building detection from aerial images in GRASS GIS environment</a></h4>
        <p class="abstract">
            Despite the current availability of various geographic data, building detection is still
            needed under some circumstances. These circumstances can include inaccessibility
            of cadastral data, unrecorded and illegal building detection and disaster mapping. A
            number of approaches has been developed to detect buildings which rely on different
            kinds of spatial and quality features such as shape or color in remotely sensed im-
            agery. The key properties differ among the various types of buildings (family house,
            factory, animal farm) and areas (city, rural area, state or country). This often re-
            quires the development of specialized detection algorithms. This work presents an
            algorithm developed to detect animal farm buildings in northern Italy. However, this
            implementation is intended to address not only the detection of farm buildings but
            to provide general tools for building detection in GRASS GIS. This work presents
            the implementation of an edge detector, line segment extractor and classification
            tool as well as the detection made on northern Italy orthophotos. All tools were
            implemented in the environment of the free and open source GIS software GRASS
            GIS. The use of free and open source software ensures that source code can be
            peer-reviewed and the analysis is highly reproducible.

        <p class="abstract">
            The program gama-local is a part of GNU Gama project and allows adjustment of local geodetic networks. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to design
            and implement support for the SQLite database in the program gama-local.
            Currently, the program gama-local supports only XML as an input. Thanks
            to this thesis program can read input data from the SQLite database. The
            thesis deals with the specifics of the use of callback functions in C++ using
            the native SQLite C/C++ Application Programming Interface. Tests of
            newly developed version of gama-local are also part of this thesis.

        <h4>Testing framework for GRASS GIS: ensuring reproducibility of scientific geospatial computing</h4>
        <p><strong>Petras, V.</strong>, Gebbert, S.</p>
        <p class="abstract">
            GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS, is used by many scientists directly or through other projects such as R or QGIS to perform geoprocessing tasks. Thus, a large number of scientific geospatial computations depend on quality and correct functionality of GRASS GIS. Automatic functionality testing is therefore necessary to ensure software reliability. Here we present a testing framework for GRASS GIS which addresses different needs of GRASS GIS and geospatial software in general. It allows to test GRASS tools (referred to as GRASS modules) and examine outputs including large raster and vector maps as well as temporal datasets. Furthermore, it enables to test all levels of GRASS GIS architecture including C and Python application programming interface and GRASS modules invoked as subprocesses. Since GRASS GIS is used as a platform for development of geospatial algorithms and models, the testing framework allows not only to test GRASS GIS core functionality but also tools developed by scientists as a part of their research. Using testing framework we can test GRASS GIS and related tools automatically and repetitively and thus detect errors caused by code changes and new developments. Tools and code are then easier to maintain which results in preserving reproducibility of scientific results over time. Similarly to open source code, the test results are publicly accessible, so that all current and potential users can see them. The usage of testing framework will be presented on an example of a test suite for r.slope.aspect module, a tool for computation of terrain slope, aspect, curvatures and other terrain characteristics.

        <h4>GRASS GIS Vector State of the Art &mdash; Gearing towards GRASS GIS 7</h4>

        <p class="abstract">
            Topology ensures that adjacent geographic components in a single vector map are related. In contrast to non-topological GIS, a border common to two areas exists only once and is shared between the two areas. Topological representation of vector data helps to produce and maintain vector maps with clean geometry as well as enables the user to perform certain analyses that can not be conducted with non-topological or spaghetti data. Non-topological vector data are automatically converted to a topological representation upon import. Further more, various cleaning tools exist to remove non-trivial topological errors.

            In the upcoming GRASS GIS 7 release the vector library was particularly improved to make it faster and more efficient with an improved internal vector file format. This new topological format reduces memory and disk space requirements, leading to a generally faster processing. Opening an existing vector requires less memory providing additionally support for large files. The new spatial index performs queries faster (compared to GRASS GIS 6 more than 10 times for large vectors). As a new option the user can select a file-based version of the spatial index for large vector data. All topological cleaning tools have been optimized with regard to processing speed, robustness, and system requirements.

            The vector engine comes with a new prototype for direct read/write support of OGR Simple Features API.
            Additionally vector data can be directly exchanged with topological PostGIS 2 databases. This enables GRASS to read and write topological primitives beside native file-based format also to the topological PostGIS 2 databases.
            Considering the wide spread usage of Esri Shapefile, a non-topological format for vector data exchange, it is particularly advantageous that GRASS GIS 7 offers advanced cleaning tools.

            For power users and programmers, the new Python interface allows to directly access functions provided by the underlying C libraries; this combines the ease of writing Python scripts with the power of optimized C functionality in the library backend.
