      <p class="abstract">
        With emerging technologies we can begin to intuitively model
        and creatively design dynamic, evolving landscapes. Advances in
        geospatial modeling, remote sensing, rapid prototyping, and 3d
        scanning are changing the way that landscapes are modeled. Now
        we can generate dynamic landscape form with process-based
        scientific models. We can build precise physical models using
        remote sensing and rapid prototyping. And we can link physical
        and digital models with real-time 3d scanning. Our new
        technology - Tangible Landscape - enables designers to
        intuitively sculpt a physical model of a landscape coupled with
        a digital model in a real-time feedback loop of 3d scanning,
        geospatial modeling, and projection. This bridges the
        digital-analog divide by combining the embodied, kinæsthetic
        creativity of traditional modes of design with the analytics
        and procedural dynamism of geospatial modeling. Since Tangible
        Landscape seamlessly integrates geospatial modeling, analysis,
        and simulation into the design process designers can assess the
        performance of landscapes and quantitatively explore the impact
        of their designs. Tangible Landscape’s real-time analytics
        enable designers to rapidly iterate through design ideas while
        rigorously testing their ideas.

      <p class="abstract">
        With the advent of the
        innovative techniques for generating high temporal and spatial
        resolution terrain models from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery,
        it has become possible to precisely map overland flow patterns.
        Furthermore, the process has become more affordable and efficient
        through the coupling of small UAS (sUAS) that are easily deployed with
        Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms that can efficiently derive 3D
        data from RGB imagery captured with consumer grade cameras. We propose
        applying the robust overland flow algorithm based on the path sampling
        technique for mapping flow paths in the arable land on a
        small test site in Raleigh, North Carolina. By comparing a time series
        of five flights in 2015 with the results of a simulation based on the
        most recent lidar derived DEM (2013), we show that the sUAS based data
        is suitable for overland flow predictions and has several advantages
        over the lidar data. The sUAS based data captures preferential flow
        along tillage and more accurately represents gullies. Furthermore the
        simulated water flow patterns over the sUAS based terrain models are
        consistent throughout the year. When terrain models are reconstructed
        only from sUAS captured RGB imagery, however, water flow modeling is
        only appropriate in areas with sparse or no vegetation cover.

          Geospatial analytics techniques describing changes of
          unstable landscapes provide critical information for hazard
          management and mitigation. We propose a method for
          quantifying horizontal migration of complex landforms based
          on the analysis of contour evolution. When applied to a set
          of elevations this technique provides comprehensive
          information on magnitude and direction of landform migration
          at any point in space and time. The method is based on the
          concept of space-time cube combined with GIS-based analysis
          applied to spatio-temporal surface. The result of the
          analysis is a vector field representing the movement and
          deformation of contours. We also present several approaches
          to visualization of these vector fields as space-time
          gradient lines, vectors or dynamic ”comets”. We demonstrate
          the method on a laboratory model and an elevation time series
          capturing evolution of a coastal sand dune.

      <p class="abstract">
          While free and open source software becomes increasingly
          important in geospatial research and industry, open science
          perspectives are generally less reflected in universities’
          educational programs. We present an example of how free and
          open source software can be incorporated into geospatial
          education to promote open and reproducible science. Since
          2008 graduate students at North Carolina State University
          have the opportunity to take a course on geospatial modeling
          and analysis that is taught with both proprietary and free
          and open source software. In this course, students perform
          geospatial tasks simultaneously in the proprietary package
          ArcGIS and the free and open source package GRASS GIS. By
          ensuring that students learn to distinguish between
          geospatial concepts and software specifics, students become
          more flexible and stronger spatial thinkers when choosing
          solutions for their independent work in the future. We also
          discuss ways to continually update and improve our publicly
          available teaching materials for reuse by teachers,
          self-learners and other members of the GIS community. Only
          when free and open source software is fully integrated into
          geospatial education, we will be able to encourage a culture
          of openness and, thus, enable greater reproducibility in
          research and development applications.

                Online publication of geospatial data is a common requirement of GIS users.
                Several free and open source solutions are available. These solutions
                include JavaScript libraries for building web map applications as well as
                server-side applications for data publishing. This project aims at GIS
                users which don't have an option to run a server-side applications
                and cannot build web map applications easily. The project consists of
                two loosely coupled parts where one or the other can be easily replaced by some other solution.
                First part is a set of web map applications. Each of them is specialized to
                different type of data, for example one application provides tools to
                show spatio-temporal data. Second part is connected to GRASS GIS and
                consists of a set of GRASS modules which provide several ways of
                exporting different types of data from GRASS GIS. Besides maps, other
                data such as statical values about maps are also exported. Connecting
                exported data and web applications is as easy as putting the files into
                the right directory. The solution enables easy publication without any
                requirements on user or publication servers and is intended to be used
                for ad hoc data sharing with colleagues which may or may not use GIS
                but for sure will appreciate interactive data visualization including
                additional information.

            We present a new, affordable version of TanGeoMS, a
            tangible  geospatial modeling and visualization system
            designed for collaboratively exploring how terrain change
            impacts landscape processes. It couples a physical,
            three-dimensional model of a landscape with geospatial
            modeling and analysis through a cycle of scanning and
            projection. Multiple users can modify the physical model
            by hand while it is being scanned; by sculpting the model
            they generate input for modeling of geophysical processes.
            The modeling results are then visualized by projecting
            images or animations back on the physical model. This
            feedback loop is an intuitive way to evaluate the impacts
            of different scenarios including anthropogenic and natural
            landscape change. Integration with GRASS GIS, a free and
            open source geographic information system, provides
            TanGeoMS with a variety of easily accessible geospatial
            analysis and modeling tools. To demonstrate the
            environmental modeling applications of TanGeoMS, we will
            demonstrate how development can be planned based on
            feedback from landscape processes such as hydrologic
            simulation and wildfire modeling with variable fuel

            This paper presents new Quantum GIS plugin for Czech
            cadastral data and its development.  QGIS is a rapidly
            developing cross-platform desktop Geographic Information
            System (GIS) released under the GNU GPL. QGIS is written in
            C++, and uses the Qt library. The plugin is developed in
            C++, too. The new plugin can work with Czech cadastral data
            in the new Czech cadastral exchange data format called VFK
            (or NVF). Data are accessed through VFK driver of the OGR
            library. The plugin should facilitate the work with
            cadastral data by easy search and presenting well arranged
            information. Information is displayed in the way similar to
            web applications, thus the control is friendly and familiar
            for users. The plugin supports interaction with map using
            QGIS functionality and it is able to export various
            cadastral reports. This paper provides ideas which can be
            generalized to develop QGIS plugin dealing with specific
            data.

            The program gama-local is a part of GNU Gama project and

            support for the SQLite database and thanks to this

      <p class="abstract">
        Today's methods of acquiring Earth surface data, namely lidar
        and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, non-selectively
        collect or generate large amounts of points. Point clouds from
        different sources vary in their properties such as number of
        returns, density, or quality. We present a set of tools with
        applications for different types of points clouds obtained by a
        lidar scanner, structure from motion technique (SfM), and a
        low-cost 3D scanner. To take advantage of the vertical
        structure of multiple return lidar point clouds, we demonstrate
        tools to process them using 3D raster techniques which allow,
        for example, the development of custom vegetation
        classification methods. Dense point clouds obtained from UAV
        imagery, often containing redundant points, can be decimated
        using various techniques before further processing. We
        implemented and compared several decimation techniques in
        regard to their performance and the final digital surface model
        (DSM). Finally, we will describe the processing of a point
        cloud from a low-cost 3D scanner, namely Microsoft Kinect, and
        its application for interaction with physical models. All the
        presented tools are open source and integrated in GRASS GIS, a
        multi-purpose open source GIS with remote sensing capabilities.
        The tools integrate with other open source projects,
        specifically Point Data Abstraction Library (PDAL), Point Cloud
        Library (PCL), and OpenKinect libfreenect2 library to benefit
        from the open source point cloud ecosystem. The implementation
        in GRASS GIS ensures long term maintenance and reproducibility
        by the scientific community but also by the original authors
        themselves.

      <p class="abstract">
        Many valuable models and tools developed by scientists are
        often inaccessible to their potential users because of
        non-existent sharing infrastructure or lack of documentation.
        Case in point is the FUTure Urban-Regional Environment
        Simulation (FUTURES), a patch-based land change model for
        generating scenario-based regional forecasts of urban growth
        pattern. Despite a high-impact publication, few scientists,
        planners, or policy makers have adopted FUTURES due to
        complexity in use and lack of direct access. We seek to address
        these issues by integrating FUTURES into GRASS GIS, a free and
        open source GIS and research platform for geospatial domain.
        This integration will enable us to take advantage of GRASS GIS
        tools for landscape structure analysis, and thus eliminate the
        need to use proprietary software for data preprocessing.
        Moreover, integration into GRASS GIS simplifies the
        distribution of FUTURES across all main operating systems and
        ensures maintainability of our project in the future. We will
        present our use case of integrating this advanced land change
        model into GRASS GIS platform and discuss the current state of
        the integration as well as the planned steps to achieve our
        vision of simple-to-use and fully free and open source FUTURES.

        <p class="abstract">
            This book presents a new type of modeling environment where users
            interact with geospatial simulations using 3D physical models of studied landscapes.
            Multiple users can alter the physical model by hand during scanning, thereby providing
            input for simulation of geophysical processes in this setting.
            The authors have developed innovative techniques and software that couple this hardware
            with open source GRASS GIS, making the system instantly applicable to a wide range of
            modeling and design problems. Since no other literature on this topic is available,
            this book fills a gap for this new technology that continues to grow.
            Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS will appeal to advanced-level students studying
            geospatial science, computer science and earth science such as  landscape architecture and natural resources. It will also benefit researchers and professionals  working in geospatial modeling applications, computer graphics, hazard risk management, hydrology, solar energy, coastal and fluvial flooding, fire spread, landscape, park design and computer games.

        <p class="abstract">
            Despite the current availability of various geographic
            data, building detection is still needed under some
            circumstances. These circumstances can include
            inaccessibility of cadastral data, unrecorded and illegal
            building detection and disaster mapping. A number of
            approaches has been developed to detect buildings which
            rely on different kinds of spatial and quality features
            such as shape or color in remotely sensed imagery. The key
            properties differ among the various types of buildings
            (family house, factory, animal farm) and areas (city, rural
            area, state or country). This often requires the
            development of specialized detection algorithms. This work
            presents an algorithm developed to detect animal farm
            buildings in northern Italy. However, this implementation
            is intended to address not only the detection of farm
            buildings but to provide general tools for building
            detection in GRASS GIS. This work presents the
            implementation of an edge detector, line segment extractor
            and classification tool as well as the detection made on
            northern Italy orthophotos. All tools were implemented in
            the environment of the free and open source GIS software
            GRASS GIS. The use of free and open source software ensures
            that source code can be peer-reviewed and the analysis is
            highly reproducible.

         <p class="abstract">
            GRASS GIS 7 is a free and open source GIS software
            developed and used by many scientists (Neteler et al.,
            2012). While some users of GRASS GIS prefer its graphical
            user interface, significant part of the scientific
            community takes advantage of various scripting and
            programing interfaces offered by GRASS GIS to develop new
            models and algorithms. Here we will present different
            interfaces added to GRASS GIS 7 and available in Python, a
            popular programming language and environment in
            geosciences. These Python interfaces are designed to
            satisfy the needs of scientists and programmers under
            various circumstances. PyGRASS  (Zambelli  et  al.,  2013)
            is  a  new  object-oriented  interface  to  GRASS  GIS
            modules  and  libraries. The GRASS GIS libraries are
            implemented in C to ensure maximum performance and the
            PyGRASS interface provides an intuitive, pythonic access to
            their functionality. GRASS GIS Python scripting library is
            another way of accessing GRASS GIS modules. It combines the
            simplicity of Bash and the efficiency of the Python syntax.
            When full access to all low-level and advanced functions
            and structures from GRASS GIS library is required, Python
            programmers can use an interface based on the Python ctypes
            package. Ctypes interface provides complete, direct access
            to all functionality as it would be available to C
            programmers. GRASS GIS provides specialized Python library
            for managing and analyzing spatio-temporal data (Gebbert
            and Pebesma, 2014). The temporal library introduces space
            time datasets representing time series of raster, 3D raster
            or vector maps and allows users to combine various
            spatio-temporal operations including queries, aggregation,
            sampling or the analysis of spatio-temporal topology. We
            will also discuss the advantages of implementing scientific
            algorithm as a GRASS GIS module and we will show how to
            write such module in Python. To facilitate the development
            of the module, GRASS GIS provides a Python library for
            testing (Petras and Gebbert, 2014) which helps researchers
            to ensure the robustness of the algorithm,  correctness  of
            the  results  in  edge  cases  as  well  as  the
            detection  of  changes  in  results  due  to  new
            development. For all modules GRASS GIS automatically
            creates standardized command line and graphical user
            interfaces and documentation. Finally, we will show how
            GRASS GIS can be used together with powerful Python tools
            such as the NumPy package and the IPython Notebook.

         <p class="abstract">
             Geographical Information System (GIS) is known for its
             capacity to spatially enhance the management of natural
             resources. While being often used as an analytical tool,
             it also represents a collaborative scientific platform to
             develop new algorithms. Thus, it is critical that GIS
             software as well as the algorithms are open and accessible
             to anybody. We present how GRASS GIS, a free and open
             source GIS, is used by many scientists to implement and
             perform geoprocessing tasks. We will show how integrating
             scientific algorithms into GRASS GIS helps to preserve
             reproducibility of scientific results over time.
             Moreover, subsequent improvements are tracked in the
             source code version control system and are immediately
             available to the public. GRASS GIS therefore acts as a
             repository of scientific peer-reviewed code, algorithm
             library, and knowledge hub for future generation of
             scientists. In the field of hydrology, with the various
             types of actual evapotranspiration (ET) models being
             developed in the last 20 years, it becomes necessary to
             inter-compare methods. Most of already published ETa
             models comparisons address few number of models, and small
             to medium areas. With the large amount
             of remote sensing data covering the Earth, and the daily
             information available for the past ten years (i.e.
             Aqua/Terra-MODIS) for each pixel location, it becomes
             paramount to have a more complete comparison, in space and
             time. To address this new experimental requirement, a
             distributed computing framework was designed, and created.
             The design architecture was built from original
             satellite datasets to various levels of processing until
             reaching the requirement of various ETa models input
             dataset. Each input product is computed once and reused in
             all ETa models requiring such input. This permits
             standardization of inputs as much as possible to zero-in
             variations of models to the models
             internals/specificities. All of the ET models are
             available in the new GRASS GIS version 7 as imagery
             modules and replicability is complete for future research.
             A set of modules for multiscale analysis of landscape
             structure was added in 1992 by Baker, who developed the
             r.le model similar to FRAGSTATS. The modules were
             gradually improved to become r.li in 2006. Further
             development continued, with a significant speed up and
             new interactive user interface. The development of spatial
             interpolation module v.surf.rst started in 1988 and
             continued by introduction of new interpolation methods and
             finally full integration into GRASS GIS version 4.
             Since then it was improved several times. The module
             is an important part of GRASS GIS and is taught at
             geospatial modeling courses, for example at North Carolina
             State University. GRASS GIS entails several modules
             that constitute the result of active research on natural
             hazard. The r.sim.water simulation  model for
             overland flow  under rainfall  excess  conditions  was
             integrated into the Emergency Routing  Decision
             Planning system as a WPS.  It  was  also
             utilized by Petrasova and is  now  part  of Tangible
             Landscape, a tangible GIS system, which also incorporated
             the r.damflood, a dam break inundation simulation. The
             wildfire simulation toolset, originally developed by Xu,
             implementing Rothermel’s model, available through the
             GRASS GIS modules r.ros and r.spread, is object of active
             research. It has been extensively tested and recently
             adapted to European fuel types.

        <h4>Testing framework for GRASS GIS: ensuring reproducibility of scientific geospatial computing</h4>
        <p><strong>Petras, V.</strong>, Gebbert, S.</p>
        <p class="abstract">
            GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS, is used by many
            scientists directly or through other projects such as R or
            QGIS to perform geoprocessing tasks. Thus, a large number
            of scientific geospatial computations depend on quality and
            correct functionality of GRASS GIS. Automatic functionality
            testing is therefore necessary to ensure software
            reliability. Here we present a testing framework for GRASS
            GIS which addresses different needs of GRASS GIS and
            geospatial software in general. It allows to test GRASS
            tools (referred to as GRASS modules) and examine outputs
            including large raster and vector maps as well as temporal
            datasets. Furthermore, it enables to test all levels of
            GRASS GIS architecture including C and Python application
            programming interface and GRASS modules invoked as
            subprocesses. Since GRASS GIS is used as a platform for
            development of geospatial algorithms and models, the
            testing framework allows not only to test GRASS GIS core
            functionality but also tools developed by scientists as a
            part of their research. Using testing framework we can test
            GRASS GIS and related tools automatically and repetitively
            and thus detect errors caused by code changes and new
            developments. Tools and code are then easier to maintain
            which results in preserving reproducibility of scientific
            results over time. Similarly to open source code, the test
            results are publicly accessible, so that all current and
            potential users can see them. The usage of testing
            framework will be presented on an example of a test suite
            for r.slope.aspect module, a tool for computation of
            terrain slope, aspect, curvatures and other terrain
            characteristics.

        <h4>GRASS GIS Vector State of the Art &mdash; Gearing towards GRASS GIS 7</h4>
        <p>Metz, M., Landa, M., Petrasova, A., <strong>Petras, V.</strong>, Chemin, Y., Neteler, M. and The GRASS GIS Development Team</p>
        <p class="abstract">
            Topology ensures that adjacent geographic components in a single vector map are related. In contrast to non-topological GIS, a border common to two areas exists only once and is shared between the two areas. Topological representation of vector data helps to produce and maintain vector maps with clean geometry as well as enables the user to perform certain analyses that can not be conducted with non-topological or spaghetti data. Non-topological vector data are automatically converted to a topological representation upon import. Further more, various cleaning tools exist to remove non-trivial topological errors.

            In the upcoming GRASS GIS 7 release the vector library was particularly improved to make it faster and more efficient with an improved internal vector file format. This new topological format reduces memory and disk space requirements, leading to a generally faster processing. Opening an existing vector requires less memory providing additionally support for large files. The new spatial index performs queries faster (compared to GRASS GIS 6 more than 10 times for large vectors). As a new option the user can select a file-based version of the spatial index for large vector data. All topological cleaning tools have been optimized with regard to processing speed, robustness, and system requirements.

            The vector engine comes with a new prototype for direct read/write support of OGR Simple Features API.
            Additionally vector data can be directly exchanged with topological PostGIS 2 databases. This enables GRASS to read and write topological primitives beside native file-based format also to the topological PostGIS 2 databases.
            Considering the wide spread usage of Esri Shapefile, a non-topological format for vector data exchange, it is particularly advantageous that GRASS GIS 7 offers advanced cleaning tools.

            For power users and programmers, the new Python interface allows to directly access functions provided by the underlying C libraries; this combines the ease of writing Python scripts with the power of optimized C functionality in the library backend.
