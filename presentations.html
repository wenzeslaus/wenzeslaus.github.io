        <p class="abstract">
            Lidar and UAV measurements produce huge point clouds which
            cannot be handled by classic GIS tools. Not true! New GRASS
            GIS version offers several tools which are specifically
            designed for processing of lidar data and point clouds in
            general. Lidar devices and structure from motion (SfM)
            processing of UAV imagery are generating large and dense
            points clouds which are hard to handle as classic GIS
            vectors. Fortunately, GRASS GIS, a powerful desktop and
            backend GIS, has a selection of tools which can handle this
            kind of data. For example, various point cloud decimations
            are useful as a pre-processing step before interpolation.
            However, the most significant group of provided analyses
            uses 2D and 3D binning for highly efficient digital terrain
            model creation and also for various vegetation and surface
            analyses. Additionally, we will explore old and new ground
            classification techniques in GRASS GIS and which analyses
            PDAL has to offer in connection with GRASS GIS. In this
            talk we will also look at point clouds from small scanners,
            namely Kinect, and how these can be processed in GRASS GIS
            in combination with PCL to couple digital elevation models
            with scaled physical models. The tools available in GRASS
            GIS can be used through a graphical user interface or in
            Bash and Python scripts which can accommodate individual
            user workflows as well as specific developer needs. We will
            see how these relate and how to take advantage of all of
            them.

        <p class="abstract">
            GRASS GIS offers a plethora of analysis for terrain and
            remote sensing processing. In this talk we will present new
            tools in GRASS GIS for processing dense point clouds
            obtained by LiDAR surveys or through structure from motion
            (SfM) processing of UAV imagery. With quality and
            efficiency in mind, we will look in detail at techniques
            for deriving raster topographic products ranging from
            micro-topography to the regional scale. We will apply GRASS
            GIS 2D and 3D raster capabilities to multiple return LiDAR
            data to derive vegetation height and density maps. We will
            also explore tools in GRASS GIS for terrain visualization
            and analysis such as sky-view factor and local relief
            model, which can help us to detect subtle terrain features
            and evaluate the quality of generated surfaces. Finally, we
            will see how GRASS GIS can work together with PDAL, a new
            and powerful point cloud processing package.

        <p class="abstract">
            Free and open source software (FOSS) is a crucial part of
            open and reproducible science and is becoming increasingly
            important for the geospatial industry. We address these
            needs in our geospatial education program by integrating
            FOSS into our courses. In our talk, we share our experience
            with teaching geospatial modeling courses at North Carolina
            State University (NCSU), focusing on the recent
            improvements, usage of new GRASS GIS 7 and incorporations
            of innovative technologies in the course materials.
            Moreover, we will show how the course material can be used
            in different countries with location specific data. Since
            2008 our graduate students have the opportunity to take a
            course on geospatial modeling and analysis taught with both
            open source and proprietary software. In the hands-on
            assignments students use the free and open source package
            GRASS GIS and the proprietary package ArcGIS to perform
            similar geospatial tasks. Each assignment is accompanied by
            a software-independent lecture on the theory behind the
            particular geospatial concepts. By using two software
            packages, our goal is to ensure that students can
            distinguish more easily between GIS concepts and specifics
            of GIS software, become true experts in GIS and gain
            flexibility to choose optimal solutions for their future
            work. Recently we have redesigned our course materials to
            be easier to follow and navigate for our on-campus and
            distance education students, but also to make them easier
            to share and modify for the FOSS community of educators.
            Our materials are static HTML websites which are highly
            portable and simple to edit. We use the Git revision
            control system in combination with GitHub to manage and
            share the source files. We developed Python scripts to
            build the website and to extract all GRASS GIS assignment
            instructions into a script which can be executed in GRASS
            GIS in order to test and ensure all instructions are
            correct and give expected results. Our teaching material is
            available online, being shared under Creative Commons
            Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license. The assignments
            in our courses are based on the “North Carolina sample
            dataset”, which is also used in GRASS GIS manual pages and
            tutorials. However, instructors in other regions often
            prefer to teach with local datasets which makes sharing of
            hands-on teaching material challenging. Therefore, we are
            currently transitioning to an updated version of the North
            Carolina sample dataset which includes frequently used and
            commonly available data with standardized names such as
            elevation, streets, or lakes. This will allow any
            instructor to create new datasets in different parts of the
            world with names compatible with our teaching materials,
            and thus helping the students to learn geospatial concepts
            in the local context. We will present sample results from
            these shared assignments for North Carolina, Puerto Rico,
            Italy and the Czech Republic.
